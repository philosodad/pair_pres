  \begin{block}{Interuptions}
  In general, a pair is better able to return to work after an interuption than an individual\cite{6227110}. 
  \end{block} 
  \begin{block}{Distractions}
  In one study, pairs were found to spend twice as much time using the IDE and half as much time surfing the web or checking email\cite{854064}.

  \begin{block}{Reduction of Defects}
  When pairs work together well, they tend to produce code with fewer defects than single programmers\cite{Canfora20071317}.
  \end{block} 
  \begin{block}{Knowledge Sharing}
  Pairing is an effective way to get new programmers up to speed, especially when those programmers are novices to a skill or environment\cite{5315998}.
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Total Velocity}
  Studies suggest that pairing either has little effect on velocity or increases overall velocity\cite{1553595}.
